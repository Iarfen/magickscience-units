# MagickScience

Hello! MagickScience is a scientific library for developing lab machines and scientific inventions. It provides units, molecules, among other features, to allow developers of scientific software to develop their software easily. Enjoy!

MagickScience is under development, but the units are already released. Molecules aren't, but they will by ready soon!

MagickScience includes special units to use, then it's unneeded to care about having the proper dimensions and prefixes when developing scientific software, you can instantiate any value you have on the machine, without performing operations with a calculator first to convert the units to a common prefix. Learn how to use them at the [Wiki](https://github.com/Iarfen/MagickScience/wiki/).

## Team

MagickScience is developed by [Ismael Correa](https://github.com/Iarfen/), a software developer of 32 years old. You can email if you find bugs, request new features, or have any other need, at ismael.correa.castro@gmail.com.

## Installation

To install MagickScience you have to use CMake and Make. The library is called msci_units, the other msci libraries aren't yet published in the web. The commands to install it are the following:

```
cmake .
make
make install
```

## Example of use

### Angle

An angle object manages angles. It stores angles in grades, rather than in radians. It can be initialized to any grade between 0 and 360 (without including 360, cause this is identical to 0 in meaning), and any initialization that's not inside this range of values gets automatically converted inside it, to his equivalent value between the range.

An example of use of angle is the following:

```cpp
// Constructors and instantiation
angle y = 54; // Better constructor! Preferred method
angle a = 367; // Gets converted to the value 7, because 7 is the equivalent of 367 inside 0 and 360
angle b = angle(12);
angle c = angle(34_Pa);
angle x = 73_angle; // Not the most optimum constructor, but equally supported
angle z = 23_N; // Angles can be instantiated with units if that is needed, although it's not recommended

// Angles operations with other angles
angle b = a + x;
angle c = a - x;
angle d = a * b;
angle e = a / c;
b += a;
c -= b;
e *= a;
c /= e;
d ^= a;

// Numeric operations
angle x = a + 3;
angle y = x - 6;
angle z = x * 3;
angle g = y / 4;
angle h = z ^ 5;
x += 3;
x -= 6;
x *= 2;
x /= 4;
x ^= 7;
x++;
++x;
x--;
--x;
float a_grade = x.get_grade();
float a_radians = x.get_radian();
x.invert(); // Inverts the angle, the orientation described by this angle points now in the opposite direction
float y = float(x); // Angles can be converted to float
```

### Scalar units

Scalar units and vector units are the central objects of MagickScience Units. They store a value and a set of dimensions, as units on science do. Scalar units are just normal values, while vector units have a value and a direction to which the vector points to.

Scalar units can operate with other scalar units, as well as with numeric primitive types. Functions like abs(), sqrt() and to_string() are supported. They have functions to operate with strings, and functions to operate with streams.

An example of use of an scalar unit is the following:

```cpp
length x = 10_m;
length y = length(8,"mm");
length z = length("10 m");
area xy = area(100,"m2");

x = 2_m;

length a = x + 3.2_dm;
length e = x - 1_mm;
area b = y * 3_m;
length c = b / 2_m;

x += 1_km;
y -= 50_cm;

length f = a + 1.5;
length g = b - 7;
length h = c * 3;
length i = c / 1.5;
area j = c ^ 2;

f += 2;
f -= 1;
g *= 1.5;
h /= 5;

x++;
y--;

x.change_dimensions("mm"); // Dimensions can be set to any prefix
x.change_dimensions("s"); // An scalar_unit can't change to other dimensions different than the dimensions they started

if (x.has_dimensions("km")) // Dimensions are compared without prefixes
{}

x.set_same_prefix(y); // Now x has dimensions "mm" as y

ostringstream out;
out << x; // scalar_unit classes can operate with streams

length w = 100_m;
string d = to_string(w); // Creates the string "100 m"

float a = abs(x); // abs() gives the absolute value of the scalar_unit
scalar_unit b = sqrt(xy); // sqrt() gives the square root of the scalar_unit
scalar_unit c = pow(a,x); // Dimensions would be "m3"

if (equal_dimensions(x,y)) // Evaluates to true if the two scalar_unit objects have the same dimensions, independent of prefixes
{}

if (x == y) // Evaluates to true if the scalar_unit objects have the same value and the same dimensions
{}

if (x == 3) // Compares by value, it's better to only compare scalar_unit. To use 3_m instead would have been better, but numeric primitive types are allow to be used
{}

length a;
cin >> a; // There's support for input streams

string a;
a += x; // Adds the scalar_unit to the string

string b = "x: " + x;
string c = x + " value";
```
### Vector units in 2D

Vector units in 2D allow to do calculations for lab machines and simulations of physics and other areas of science in 2 dimensions. They inherit scalar_unit, and additional to his member-variables they include the member-variable theta, of class angle (described above).

An example of use of it is the following:

```cpp
force_2d x = force_2d(21_N,56_angle); // Creates a force_2d with a value of 21 N and an inclination angle of 56º
force_2d y = force_2d(32,"mN",11); // vector_unid_2d of force with values "32 mN 11º"
vector_unit_2d z = vector_unid_2d(10,"kPa",48); // vector_unit_2d with values "10 kPa 48º"

x.theta += 21_angle; // theta of x can be accessed directed and used as any angle, it's the better way to use it

x += y; // Sum a vector of the same dimensions
y -= z; // Substraction supported. Can't substract vectors of different dimensions

force_2d a = x + y; // Sum of vector_unid_2d
force_2d b = x - y; // Substraction of vector_unid_2d

velocity_2d acc = acceleration_2d("5 m/s") * 100_s; // vector_unid_2d can multiply with scalar_unit
vector_unid_2d p = x / area("10 m2"); // vector_unid_2d can divide with scalar_unit

vector_unid_2d ab = x + 4; // vector_unid_2d can sum with numeric primitive types
vector_unid_2d ac = y - 7; // vector_unid_2d can substract with numeric primitive types
vector_unid_2d ad = x * 3; // vector_unid_2d can multiply with numeric primitive types
vector_unid_2d ae = y / 5; // vector_unid_2d can divide with numeric primitive types
vector_unid_2d xy = x ^ 2; // vector_unid_2d can power with numeric primitive types

x += 3; // vector_unid_2d with operator+= for numeric primitive types
y -= 9; // vector_unid_2d with operator-= for numeric primitive types
x *= 2; // vector_unid_2d with operator*= for numeric primitive types
y /= 6; // vector_unid_2d with operator/= for numeric primitive types

force e = x.x_projection(); // vector_unid_2d projection on the x axis
force f = x.y_projection(); // vector_unid_2d projection on the y axis

x.invert(); // Now x points to the opposite direction

string x_display = to_string(x); // Prints "21N 56º"
energy c = norm(x) * 2_m; // Use of norm() for vector_unit_2d
vector_unid_2d xy = sqrt(x^4); // Gives x ^ 2
vector_unid_2d xy = sqrt_nth(x^4,4); // Gives x
scalar_unit a = dot_product(x,y); // Gives the dot product of x and y, which is an scalar_unit
angle b = angle_between(x,y); // Gives the angle between the two vectors

if (same_direction(x,y)) // Gives true if the vectors point to the same direction
{}

if (parallel(x,y)) // Gives true if the vectors are parallel (point to the same or to the opposite direction)
{}

if (orthogonal(x,y)) // Gives true if the vectors are orthogonal (have 90º of difference in the direction they point to)
{}

if (x == y) // Gives true if the two vector_unit_2d are equal. There's the operator != too
{}

if (x == "21N 56º") // Gives true if the vector is the specified by the string. There's the operator != too
{}

string b;
b =+ x; // Appends x to the string b
string c = "x: " + x; // Creates a new string by inserting x as with to_string(x)
string d = x + " is a vector"; // Both directions are supported for creating strings with vector_unit_2d

cout << x; // Prints x in the output stream, any ostream can be used, not only cout. x is printed with to_string

vector_unit_2d a;
cin >> a; // Initializes a with the string given to cin

```

### Vector units in 3D

Vector units in 3D are the most useful vectorial units. They allow to do all the simulations of physics and any other area of science in 3D, which is the most common scenario. To work, they have, as vector_unit_2d, a value, dimensions, and an angle theta, but they include the angle phi. So, they work as spherical coordinates, having cartesian projections for each axis. The class vector_unit_3d inherits from scalar_unit, as vector_unit_2d, but not from vector_unit_2d, evading math errors that would be derived from that, because 2D and 3D dimensions are not mathematically equivalent in 2D (when projecting the x and y axis there appears the angle phi on the equations for the 3D cases).

An example of use is the following:

```cpp
force_3d x = force_3d(45_N,12_angle); // Creates a force_3d with a value of 45 N and an inclination angle of 12º
force_3d y = force_3d(78,"kN",67); // vector_unid_3d of force with values "78 mN 67º"
vector_unit_3d z = vector_unid_3d(100,"MPa",60); // vector_unit_3d with values "100 MPa 60º"

x.theta += 16; // theta of x can be accessed directed and used as any angle, it's the better way to use it
x.phi = 90; // phi of x can be accessed directly too

x += y; // Sum a vector of the same dimensions
y -= z; // Substraction supported. Can't substract vectors of different dimensions

force_3d a = x + y; // Sum of vector_unid_3d
force_3d b = x - y; // Substraction of vector_unid_3d

velocity_3d acc = acceleration_3d("25 m/s") * 100_s; // vector_unid_3d can multiply with scalar_unit
vector_unid_3d p = x / area("100 m2"); // vector_unid_3d can divide with scalar_unit

vector_unid_3d ab = x + 16; // vector_unid_3d can sum with numeric primitive types
vector_unid_3d ac = y - 98; // vector_unid_3d can substract with numeric primitive types
vector_unid_3d ad = x * 2; // vector_unid_3d can multiply with numeric primitive types
vector_unid_3d ae = y / 8; // vector_unid_3d can divide with numeric primitive types
vector_unid_3d xy = x ^ 4; // vector_unid_3d can power with numeric primitive types

x += 7; // vector_unid_3d with operator+= for numeric primitive types
y -= 19; // vector_unid_3d with operator-= for numeric primitive types
x *= 4; // vector_unid_3d with operator*= for numeric primitive types
y /= 2; // vector_unid_3d with operator/= for numeric primitive types

force e = x.x_projection(); // vector_unid_3d projection on the x axis
force f = x.y_projection(); // vector_unid_3d projection on the y axis
force f = x.z_projection(); // vector_unid_3d projection on the z axis

x.invert(); // Now x points to the opposite direction

string x_display = to_string(x); // Prints "45N 12º"
energy c = norm(x) * 2_m; // Use of norm() for vector_unit_3d
vector_unid_3d xy = sqrt(x^4); // Gives x ^ 2
vector_unid_3d xy = sqrt_nth(x^4,4); // Gives x
scalar_unit a = dot_product(x,y); // Gives the dot product of x and y, which is an scalar_unit
vector_unit_3d b = cross_product(x,y); // Gives the cross product of x and y, which is a vector_unit_3d
angle b = angle_between(x,y); // Gives the angle between the two vectors

if (same_direction(x,y)) // Gives true if the vectors point to the same direction
{}

if (parallel(x,y)) // Gives true if the vectors are parallel (point to the same or to the opposite direction)
{}

if (orthogonal(x,y)) // Gives true if the vectors are orthogonal (have 90º of difference in the direction they point to)
{}

if (x == y) // Gives true if the two vector_unit_3d are equal. There's the operator != too
{}

if (x == "45N 12º") // Gives true if the vector is the specified by the string. There's the operator != too
{}

string b;
b =+ x; // Appends x to the string b
string c = "x: " + x; // Creates a new string by inserting x as with to_string(x)
string d = x + " is a vector"; // Both directions are supported for creating strings with vector_unit_3d

cout << x; // Prints x in the output stream, any ostream can be used, not only cout. x is printed with to_string

vector_unit_3d a;
cin >> a; // Initializes a with the string given to cin

```

### Vector units in ND

Vector units in ND are very interesting vector units. They allow to operate in ND, which means, inside MagickScience, that the dimensions can be changed. ND allows to operate in 1D, 2D, 3D and more dimensions at the same time. The way they allow that is with a vector<angle> member-variable, which allows to control the angles of the n dimensions were the vector operates. For 2D it has one angle, as vector_unit_2d, and for 3D it has two angles, as vector_unit_3d. For 1D it doesn't has any angle.

An example of use is the following:

```cpp
force_nd x = force_nd(29_N,{8_angle,16_angle,32_angle}); // Creates a force_nd with a value of 29 N and an inclination angle of 8º, another of 16º and another of 32º
force_nd y = force_nd(44,"dN",{55,13,42}); // vector_unid_nd of force with values "44 dN 55º 13º 42º"
vector_unit_nd z = vector_unit_nd(81,"MPa",{32,44,67}); // vector_unit_nd with values "81 MPa 32º 44º 67º"

x.angles[0] += 7; // theta of x can be accessed directed and used as any angle, it's the better way to use it
x.angles[1] = 71; // phi of x can be accessed directly too
x.angles[2] -= 4;

x += y; // Sum a vector of the same dimensions
y -= z; // Substraction supported. Can't substract vectors of different dimensions

force_nd a = x + y; // Sum of vector_unit_nd
force_nd b = x - y; // Substraction of vector_unit_nd

velocity_nd acc = acceleration_nd("19 m/s",{14,52,33}) * 80_s; // vector_unit_nd can multiply with scalar_unit
vector_unit_nd p = x / area("100 m2"); // vector_unit_nd can divide with scalar_unit

vector_unit_nd ab = x + 9; // vector_unit_nd can sum with numeric primitive types
vector_unit_nd ac = y - 78; // vector_unit_nd can substract with numeric primitive types
vector_unit_nd ad = x * 3; // vector_unit_nd can multiply with numeric primitive types
vector_unit_nd ae = y / 5; // vector_unit_nd can divide with numeric primitive types
vector_unit_nd xy = x ^ 3; // vector_unit_nd can power with numeric primitive types

x += 45; // vector_unit_nd with operator+= for numeric primitive types
y -= 15; // vector_unit_nd with operator-= for numeric primitive types
x *= 3; // vector_unit_nd with operator*= for numeric primitive types
y /= 7; // vector_unit_nd with operator/= for numeric primitive types

force e = x.x_projection(); // vector_unit_nd projection on the x axis
force f = x.y_projection(); // vector_unit_nd projection on the y axis
force f = x.z_projection(); // vector_unit_nd projection on the z axis

force f = x.n_projection(2); // vector_unit_nd projection on the y axis, any axis can be specified. x is 1, y is 2, z is 3

x.invert(); // Now x points to the opposite direction

string x_display = to_string(x); // Prints "29N 8º 16º 32º"
energy c = norm(x) * 2_m; // Use of norm() for vector_unit_nd
vector_unid_nd xy = sqrt(x^4); // Gives x ^ 2
vector_unid_nd xy = sqrt_nth(x^4,4); // Gives x
scalar_unit a = dot_product(x,y); // Gives the dot product of x and y, which is an scalar_unit
vector_unit_nd b = cross_product(x,y); // Gives the cross product of x and y, which is a vector_unit_nd
angle b = angle_between(x,y); // Gives the angle between the two vectors

if (same_nd(x,y)) // Gives true if the vector have the same ND, if both are 2D, both are 3D, or both are 1D
{}

if (same_direction(x,y)) // Gives true if the vectors point to the same direction
{}

if (parallel(x,y)) // Gives true if the vectors are parallel (point to the same or to the opposite direction)
{}

if (orthogonal(x,y)) // Gives true if the vectors are orthogonal (have 90º of difference in the direction they point to)
{}

if (x == y) // Gives true if the two vector_unit_nd are equal. There's the operator != too
{}

if (x == "29N 8º 16º 32º") // Gives true if the vector is the specified by the string. There's the operator != too
{}

string b;
b =+ x; // Appends x to the string b
string c = "x: " + x; // Creates a new string by inserting x as with to_string(x)
string d = x + " is a vector"; // Both directions are supported for creating strings with vector_unit_nd

cout << x; // Prints x in the output stream, any ostream can be used, not only cout. x is printed with to_string

vector_unit_nd a;
cin >> a; // Initializes a with the string given to cin

```
