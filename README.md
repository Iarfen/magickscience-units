# MagickScience

Hello! MagickScience is a scientific library for developing lab machines. It provides units, molecules, among other features, to allow developers of scientific software to develop their software easily. Enjoy!

MagickScience is under development, but the units are already released. Molecules aren't, but they will by ready soon!

## Units

MagickScience includes special units to use, then it's unneeded to care about having the proper dimensions and prefixes when developing scientific software. Learn how to use them at the [Wiki](https://github.com/Iarfen/MagickScience/wiki/).

## Atoms and molecules

MagickScience has atoms and molecules to use inside scientific software! It's under development, but a big amount is ready. It'll be completed in some months!

## Team

MagickScience is developed by [Ismael Correa](https://github.com/Iarfen/), a software developer of 27 years old. You can email if you find bugs, request new features, or have any other need, at ismael.correa.castro@gmail.com.

## Installation

To install MagickScience you have to use CMake and Make. The library is called msci_units, the other msci libraries aren't yet published in the web. The commands to install it are the following:

```
cmake .
make
make install
```

## Example of use

### Angle

An angle object manages angles. It stores angles in grades, rather than in radians. It can be initialized to any grade between 0 and 360 (without including 360, cause this is identical to 0 in meaning), and any initialization that's not inside this range of values gets automatically converted inside it, to his equivalent value between the range.

An example of use of angle is the following:

```cpp
// Constructors and instantiation
angle y = 54; // Better constructor! Preferred method
angle a = 367; // Gets converted to the value 7, because 7 is the equivalent of 367 inside 0 and 360
angle b = angle(12);
angle c = angle(34_Pa);
angle x = 73_angle; // Not the most optimum constructor, but equally supported
angle z = 23_N; // Angles can be instantiated with units if that is needed, although it's not recommended

// Angles operations with other angles
angle b = a + x;
angle c = a - x;
angle d = a * b;
angle e = a / c;
b += a;
c -= b;
e *= a;
c /= e;
d ^= a;

// Numeric operations
angle x = a + 3;
angle y = x - 6;
angle z = x * 3;
angle g = y / 4;
angle h = z ^ 5;
x += 3;
x -= 6;
x *= 2;
x /= 4;
x ^= 7;
x++;
++x;
x--;
--x;
float a_grade = x.get_grade();
float a_radians = x.get_radian();
x.invert(); // Inverts the angle, the orientation described by this angle points now in the opposite direction
float y = float(x); // Angles can be converted to float
```

### Scalar units

Scalar units and vector units are the central objects of MagickScience Units. They store a value and a set of dimensions, as units on science do. Scalar units are just normal values, while vector units have a value and a direction to which the vector points to.

Scalar units can operate with other scalar units, as well as with numeric primitive types. Functions like abs(), sqrt() and to_string() are supported. They have functions to operate with strings, and functions to operate with streams.

An example of use of an scalar unit is the following:

```cpp
length x = 10_m;
length y = length(8,"mm");
length z = length("10 m");
area xy = area(100,"m2");

x = 2_m;

length a = x + 3.2_dm;
length e = x - 1_mm;
area b = y * 3_m;
length c = b / 2_m;

x += 1_km;
y -= 50_cm;

length f = a + 1.5;
length g = b - 7;
length h = c * 3;
length i = c / 1.5;
area j = c ^ 2;

f += 2;
f -= 1;
g *= 1.5;
h /= 5;

x++;
y--;

x.change_dimensions("mm"); // Dimensions can be set to any prefix
x.change_dimensions("s"); // An scalar_unit can't change to other dimensions different than the dimensions they started

if (x.has_dimensions("km")) // Dimensions are compared without prefixes
{}

x.set_same_prefix(y); // Now x has dimensions "mm" as y

ostringstream out;
out << x; // scalar_unit classes can operate with streams

length w = 100_m;
string d = to_string(w); // Creates the string "100 m"

float a = abs(x); // abs() gives the absolute value of the scalar_unit
scalar_unit b = sqrt(xy); // sqrt() gives the square root of the scalar_unit
scalar_unit c = pow(a,x); // Dimensions would be "m3"

if (equal_dimensions(x,y)) // Evaluates to true if the two scalar_unit objects have the same dimensions, independent of prefixes
{}

if (x == y) // Evaluates to true if the scalar_unit objects have the same value and the same dimensions
{}

if (x == 3) // Compares by value, it's better to only compare scalar_unit. To use 3_m instead would have been better, but numeric primitive types are allow to be used
{}

length a;
cin >> a; // There's support for input streams

string a;
a += x; // Adds the scalar_unit to the string

string b = "x: " + x;
string c = x + " value";
```
