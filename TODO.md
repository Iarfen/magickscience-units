SCIFIR UNITS - VERSION 2

// BUILD
// TODO: Add the boost configuration for Windows, by adding a variable that sets the path of boost
// TODO: Rename msci.pc to scifir-units.pc, and change it accordingly
// TODO: try to integrate the library to MSYS2

// COORDINATES AND POINTS
// TODO: finish get_altitude(). Read about geographic coordinates and decide what to do in point_3d, point_nd, coordinates_3d and coordinates_nd
// TODO: displacement_nd in point_nd class should be initialized with zero dimensions instead of m?. Check the all the default dimensions cases for point_nd, coordinates_nd and coordinates_ndr
// TODO: think on the different cases of use of coordinates and document them, including the use of an origin
// TODO: add coordinates_3d::origin() to allow to initialize with an origin, it's specially useful for geographic coordinates
// TODO: add the construction with an string for geographic coordinates
// TODO: document the coordinates for the universe, publish that too as an standard inside scifir

// VECTOR FIELDS
// TODO: vector_field (it should operate with vector_units and maybe with scalar_units. With (x,y,z) it gives the respective vector). +, - and ^ with vector_field, + - * with vector_unit
// TODO: Typecasting of vector_unit to math_vector, boost_Ublas_vector, etc. Same for math_vector to vector_unit

// C++
// TODO: check how are inline constructors and constexpr constructors
// TODO: use of constexpr
// TODO: use scientific notation for the avogadro constant
// TODO: change the use of const-reference to value and std::move in constructors
// TODO: change the use of const-reference to value and std::move in other places
// TODO: use reference when instantiating variables and when it's not needed to instantiate by value inside the body of functions
// TODO: possible use of #pragma?
// TODO: if size_t and other similar constants are intended to be used inside normal code

// DIMENSIONS
// TODO: support the binary prefixes too
// TODO: see how to free the char[]

// UNITS
// TODO: finish the tests of all the unit classes
// TODO: allow to display in any conversion. By default it should always display in SI units, only if a conversion is expressly specified in the display functions the conversion is then the dimension that gets displayed
// TODO: check dimensions in all inheriting classes of scalar_unit and vector_unit, it's needed another constructor that checks them
// TODO: Regex that checks all the invalid dimensions initialization inside a static_assert (create a static function of valid_dimensions_string()). Maybe try first by undefining the value if there's something that doesn't exist (with an else). It's possible to test, with static_assert, that dimension == nullptr, abbreviation == nullptr and conversion == nullptr
// TODO: Detect when there's the same dimension at the numerator and at the denominator of the string initialization
// TODO: add "[]" optionally to display() functions of scalar_unit surrounding the dimensions

// PREDEFINED UNITS
// TODO: think if to add accoustic and matter predefined units, or if it's not needed
// TODO: delete all field classes that currently are vector_units, and make them fields
// TODO: move cas_number to a special_unit, or even to another category

// MECA NUMBERS
// TODO: add the allowed typenames to lab_number, and don't accept any other type
// TODO: lab_number should have another symbol in place of +-
// TODO: lab_number should handle the error of display like scalar_unit classes

// BASIC UNITS
// TODO: think if to add another concentration class, the previous one has been deprecated

// SPECIAL UNIS - EXTRA
// ip class? check networking libraries of C++ and decide if to add it here
// isbn class
// issn class
// nutrition_information

// EMOTIONAL UNITS
// TODO: add the emotions as enum, not as dimensions
// TODO: add the feelings as enum
// TODO: add the sensations as enum

// SPECIAL UNITS
// TODO: complete color class like coordinate classes, with all the getters of all the different color versions, like get_h(), get_s(), get_v()
// TODO: pixel_color<>. Use monochrome_pixel, truecolor_pixel, etc, as typedefs of pixel_color<>
// TODO: complex_number<> should have trigonometric functions for complex numbers
// TODO: maybe create a mesh_3d class, or vector<point_3d<>>
// TODO: study the geographic coordinates deeply, and see if to add something more related to them

// UNITS - ADVANCED
// TODO: sqrt() and pow() maybe should be direct for created units, instead of passing by scalar_unit again to initialize after that the other unit
// TODO: check if it's needed to add a function is_si_basic_dimension() that gives whether the dimension is basic or not in the sense of the SI system of units
// TODO: support and UTF32 string constructor for scalar_unit in order to allow to create dimensions directly with some Unicode characters that are not present in UTF8
// TODO: scalar_unit should have is_valid() with some system
// TODO: think if to make scalar_unit a template class converting the default type of the value member-variable to float type
// TODO: support the conversions natively
// TODO: add the operators +,-,* and / in the derived classes of scalar_unit and vector_unit with the same class in order to avoid to check that the dimensions are the same, that saves time
// TODO: check the object code resulting by testing different functions of the unit classes
// TODO: 2d display of scalar_units and of vector_units (create a scifir_units_2d library for it)
// TODO: 3d display of scalar_units and of vector_units (create a scifir_units_3d library for it)

// UNITS - ADVANCED - REDUCTION OF MEMORY CONSUMPTION
// OPTION 1: maybe delete the dimensions member-variable of scalar_unit, and use instead another system for handling prefixes. The dimensions can be automatic based on their class. One possibility is to use an empty array and, when it's empty, to send the fixed dimensions of the class instead, and only when changing something to add the dimensions there
// OPTION 2: divide single dimensions unit of multiple-dimensions unit by adding only one dimension instead of the vector<dimension>
// OPTION 3: maybe the prefix and the dimension can be removed as member-variables if displaying automatically in some way or another, as it's expressly specified. That is maybe the biggest optimization possible
// OPTION 4: light_length which uses only an enum of prefixes and a value, maybe it should be called length, and length should be called full_length
// OPTION 4 - TODO: add const to the enum of light_unit
// AFTER SOME OPTION - TODO: finish initial_dimensions_get_structure() and get_dimensions_match() related to the new implementation

// ISOs
// TODO: Publish the ISO of geographic location based on aid and zid classes
// TODO: See if to make an ISO of an official symbol for money (not a concrete money of a country, but a universal one)
// TODO: Add "depth" to an ISO of names for the lengths of objects (width, height and depth are the names). It's needed to have a name in spanish for the depth too
// TODO: Maybe create an "ISO" of geographic positioning taking the major axis of the planet, which can be the Earth or not, and adding 50 km to it, in order to have a border of safety in order to be sure that no point remains uncovered by the imaginary sphere that the geographic positioning creates around the planet. It can be used for any planet of the universe. The center of the planet is considered always the geometrical one, not the center of mass, because that last one changes with changes of the distribution of mass inside the planet

// ISO C++
// TODO: add ยบ to the string literals

// MATERIAL_VECTOR_UNIT
