Welcome! The {\bfseries{Scifir Collection}} is a set of scientific libraries, written in {\bfseries{C++}}, for developing {\bfseries{laboratory machines}} and {\bfseries{scientific inventions}}. It provides units, molecules, among other features, to allow developers of scientific software to develop their software and firmware easily. Enjoy!

The Scifir Collection is under development, but the units are already released. Molecules aren\textquotesingle{}t, but they will by ready soon!

{\bfseries{scifir-\/units}} includes units with dimensions to use, then it\textquotesingle{}s unneeded to care about having the proper dimensions and prefixes when developing scientific software, you can instantiate any value you have on the machine, without performing operations with a calculator first to convert the units to a common prefix. Learn how to use them at the \href{https://github.com/scifir/scifir-units/wiki}{\texttt{ Wiki}}. It\textquotesingle{}s been developed under {\bfseries{C++20}} and uses {\bfseries{cmake}} as build automation tool. It\textquotesingle{}s available for {\bfseries{Linux distributions}} and {\bfseries{Windows}}.

The {\bfseries{current version}} of scifir-\/units is the {\bfseries{beta-\/version-\/2.\+0}}. The version 1.\+0 has never been released because the version 2.\+0 was better by a great extent. The version 2.\+0 includes a better inheritance system and a wide simplification of all the programming of the library and, then, a better compilation and a saving of RAM for each instantiation of each class. Because of that reason, the version 2.\+0 has been preferred over the version 1.\+0.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md6}{}\doxysubsection{Team}\label{index_autotoc_md6}

The {\bfseries{Scifir Foundation}} is looking for {\bfseries{funding}}, in order to do some digital marketing and pay some other needs of the project. If you want to support this libraries, {\bfseries{science will thank you}} for that, you can donate in this \href{https://github.com/sponsors/iarfen}{\texttt{ sponsors page}}.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md8}{}\doxysection{Installation}\label{index_autotoc_md8}
To install {\bfseries{scifir-\/units}} you have to use {\bfseries{CMake}} and {\bfseries{make}}. scifir-\/units can be compiled with {\bfseries{g++}}, {\bfseries{clang++}} and {\bfseries{msvc}}. Also, {\bfseries{nvcc}} and {\bfseries{dpcpp}} can also be used. The compilers for microcontrollers can also be used.

scifir-\/units uses {\bfseries{icu}} and {\bfseries{boost}} libraries. Of boost, it uses boost-\/system. You have to install those two libraries in order to install scifir-\/units. To do so, use {\bfseries{apt}} in Ubuntu and Debian, {\bfseries{yum}} for Fedora and similar distributions, or another package manager if your Linux distribution doesn\textquotesingle{}t use those two. Inside Windows, install those libraries through {\bfseries{vcpkg}}, if you want to build scifir-\/units as lib or dll, or through {\bfseries{mingw}}, if you want to use scifir-\/units as on Linux distributions.

Also, if you want to compile the tests, you\textquotesingle{}ll need the library {\bfseries{catch2}}, which you can install with the same package manager that you have used to install icu and boost.

If you want to change the compiler to use you have to use the argument {\bfseries{-\/DCMAKE\+\_\+\+CXX\+\_\+\+COMPILER}} in the first cmake command, the cmake command with the --preset argument. There, you can specify, for example, -\/DCMAKE\+\_\+\+CXX\+\_\+\+COMPILER=clang++, to use the {\bfseries{clang++}} compiler. You can also specify flags for the compiler using the argument {\bfseries{-\/DCMAKE\+\_\+\+CXX\+\_\+\+FLAGS}}.

The environment variables needed to be set in your operating system to build scifir-\/units vary depending on the preset you want to use. For Linux and the WSL (the Windows Subsystem for Linux), you don\textquotesingle{}t need to set any environment variable. For Windows, that\textquotesingle{}s, inside Windows but outside Min\+GW, you need to set {\bfseries{VCPKG\+\_\+\+ROOT}} to the installation directory of vcpkg and {\bfseries{VCPKG\+\_\+\+DEFAULT\+\_\+\+TRIPLET}} to the default triplet you\textquotesingle{}re using in that installation of vcpkg. For all builds using vcpkg, even outside Windows, you need to set VCPKG\+\_\+\+ROOT and VCPKG\+\_\+\+DEFAULT\+\_\+\+TRIPLET, not only inside Windows. For Min\+GW you need to set {\bfseries{MINGW64\+\_\+\+DIR}} to the installation directory of Min\+GW. For Android NDK you need to set {\bfseries{ANDROID\+\_\+\+NDK\+\_\+\+ROOT}} to the installation directory of the NDK version you\textquotesingle{}re using (select the folder of the version, there can be more than one version of Android NDK installed in the same installation of Android SDK and Android Studio). To build for microcontrollers you don\textquotesingle{}t need to set any environment variable, but you need to point CMAKE\+\_\+\+CXX\+\_\+\+COMPILER to the C++ compiler of the toolchain of the microcontroller you want, and set the flag -\/mmcu of your C++ compiler using CMAKE\+\_\+\+CXX\+\_\+\+FLAGS=\char`\"{}-\/mmcu=$<$mmcu-\/model$>$\char`\"{} to the model of your microcontroller.

If, for any reason, you need to configure something inside your local installation of cmake to build scifir-\/units, or if you have any problem building scifir-\/units, check the documentation of cmake here\+: \href{https://www.cmake.org/documentation}{\texttt{ https\+://www.\+cmake.\+org/documentation}}. cmake is a software easy to use, and you shouldn\textquotesingle{}t need more than some days of study (thinking that you don\textquotesingle{}t know cmake yet) to fully learn it.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md9}{}\doxysubsubsection{Configuring cmake for boost}\label{index_autotoc_md9}
To build scifir-\/units you need to configure cmake to find boost with the module {\bfseries{Find\+Boost.\+cmake}}. To do so, set the environment variables of cmake called {\bfseries{CMAKE\+\_\+\+INCLUDE\+\_\+\+PATH}} to the include directory (usually $\ast$$\ast$/usr/include$\ast$$\ast$ in Linux) and {\bfseries{CMAKE\+\_\+\+LIBRARY\+\_\+\+PATH}} to the link directory (usually $\ast$$\ast$/usr/lib$\ast$$\ast$ in Linux). The include directory usually doesn\textquotesingle{}t change with Linux distributions, but the link directory does. The link directory can be, for example, $\ast$$\ast$/usr/lib/x86\+\_\+64-\/gnu-\/linux$\ast$$\ast$ in Debian, $\ast$$\ast$/usr/lib64$\ast$$\ast$ in Fedora, $\ast$$\ast$/usr/lib$\ast$$\ast$ in Arch Linux, other Linux distributions have others link directories.

The link directories of various Linux distributions are the following, set CMAKE\+\_\+\+LIBRARY\+\_\+\+PATH based on the Linux distribution you\textquotesingle{}re using to build scifir-\/units\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{Debian\+:}} /usr/lib/x86\+\_\+64-\/gnu-\/linux.
\item {\bfseries{Ubuntu\+:}} /usr/lib/x86\+\_\+64-\/gnu-\/linux.
\item {\bfseries{KDE Neon\+:}} /usr/lib/x86\+\_\+64-\/gnu-\/linux.
\item {\bfseries{Linux Mint\+:}} /usr/lib/x86\+\_\+64-\/gnu-\/linux.
\item {\bfseries{Fedora\+:}} /usr/lib64.
\item {\bfseries{Cent\+OS\+:}} /usr/lib64.
\item {\bfseries{Arch Linux\+:}} /usr/lib.
\item {\bfseries{Manjaro\+:}} /usr/lib.
\item {\bfseries{Open\+SUSE Leap\+:}} /usr/lib64.
\item {\bfseries{Open\+SUSE Tumbleweed\+:}} /usr/lib64.
\item {\bfseries{Gentoo\+:}} /usr/lib64.
\end{DoxyItemize}

In Windows, you have to set the include directory and the link directory of the toolchain you\textquotesingle{}re using to build scifir-\/units. For Windows builds, scifir-\/units comes with the toolchains vcpkg and mingw already configured. If you use another toolchain, look the files CMake\+Lists.\+txt and CMake\+Presets.\+json to configure your toolchain in the same manner as vcpkg and mingw. Also, cmake can find the boost library when you\textquotesingle{}re using vcpkg only if you set the environment variable {\bfseries{VCPKG\+\_\+\+ROOT}} to be the installation path of vcpkg.

Also, to configure cmake to find boost with the module Find\+Boost.\+cmake you have to set the variables {\bfseries{Boost\+\_\+\+LIB\+\_\+\+PREFIX}}, {\bfseries{Boost\+\_\+\+ARCHITECTURE}} and {\bfseries{Boost\+\_\+\+COMPILER}} to the respective values of the version of boost that you\textquotesingle{}ve installed in order for the script {\bfseries{Find\+Boost}} to work. If, when using cmake, boost is not found, check a documentation of Find\+Boost, or just look at the file {\bfseries{Find\+Boost.\+cmake}}, to correct the problem that impedes cmake to find boost, otherwise scifir-\/units can\textquotesingle{}t be build. The names of boost libraries follow the following convention\+:

\$\{Boost\+\_\+\+LIB\+\_\+\+PREFIX\}\$\{Boost\+\_\+\+NAMESPACE\}\+\_\+\$\{component\}\$\{Boost\+\_\+\+COMPILER\}\$\{Boost\+\_\+\+USE\+\_\+\+MULTITHREADED\}\$\{\+\_\+boost\+\_\+\+RELEASE\+\_\+\+ABI\+\_\+\+TAG\}\$\{Boost\+\_\+\+ARCHITECTURE\}-\/\$\{Boost\+\_\+\+LIB\+\_\+\+VERSION\}

Just look at your boost libraries which name they have and set all those variables to those values.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md10}{}\doxysubsection{Linux}\label{index_autotoc_md10}
The commands to install scifir-\/units in Linux distribution are the following (it also works inside {\bfseries{WSL}})\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{cmake -\/-\/preset=linux}
\DoxyCodeLine{cmake -\/-\/build -\/-\/preset=linux}
\DoxyCodeLine{cmake -\/-\/install ./build/linux}

\end{DoxyCode}


Optionally, you can change the installation directory by setting {\bfseries{CMAKE\+\_\+\+INSTALL\+\_\+\+PREFIX}} when running the first command. Set it using -\/DCMAKE\+\_\+\+INSTALL\+\_\+\+PREFIX=$<$path-\/to-\/installation-\/directory$>$.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md11}{}\doxysubsection{Windows}\label{index_autotoc_md11}
To install scifir-\/units inside Windows you have to specify a path to some Windows folder, the file {\bfseries{scifir-\/units.\+lib}} will be installed there, and also the headers. You have to install using {\bfseries{vcpkg}} the packages {\bfseries{icu}} and {\bfseries{boost\+\_\+system}} in order to build the library. The commands are the following\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{cmake -\/-\/preset=windows -\/DCMAKE\_INSTALL\_PREFIX=<path-\/to-\/windows-\/dir>}
\DoxyCodeLine{cmake -\/-\/build -\/-\/preset=windows}
\DoxyCodeLine{cmake -\/-\/install ./build/windows}

\end{DoxyCode}


To compile for Windows Universal Applications, which targets both Windows Store and Windows Phone, you have to use the flags {\bfseries{-\/DCMAKE\+\_\+\+SYSTEM\+\_\+\+NAME=Windows\+Store}} and {\bfseries{-\/DCMAKE\+\_\+\+SYSTEM\+\_\+\+VERSION=\char`\"{}10.\+0\char`\"{}}} with the first command (the command which specifies the preset). CMAKE\+\_\+\+SYSTEM\+\_\+\+VERSION can be higher than 10.\+0, but no lower.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md12}{}\doxysubsection{Min\+GW}\label{index_autotoc_md12}
To install scifir-\/units inside Min\+GW you have to configure {\bfseries{Min\+GW}} with the environment variable {\bfseries{MINGW64\+\_\+\+DIR}}, which sets the path to the installation directory of Min\+GW. Inside Min\+GW you need to install {\bfseries{icu}} and {\bfseries{boost\+\_\+system}}. Then, execute the following commands\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{cmake -\/-\/preset=windows-\/mingw}
\DoxyCodeLine{cmake -\/-\/build -\/-\/preset=windows-\/mingw}
\DoxyCodeLine{cmake -\/-\/install ./build/windows-\/mingw}

\end{DoxyCode}
\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md13}{}\doxysubsection{Mac\+OS and Apple devices}\label{index_autotoc_md13}
scifir-\/units uses the XCode generator of cmake to compile for Mac\+OS. You need to install icu and boost\+\_\+system to build scifir-\/units inside Mac\+OS. The commands to compile and install scifir-\/units inside Mac\+OS are the following\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{cmake -\/-\/preset=macos}
\DoxyCodeLine{cmake -\/-\/build -\/-\/preset=macos}
\DoxyCodeLine{cmake -\/-\/install ./build/macos}

\end{DoxyCode}


To compile scifir-\/units for i\+OS, tv\+OS, vision\+OS or watch\+OS you must add the flag {\bfseries{-\/DCMAKE\+\_\+\+SYSTEM\+\_\+\+NAME=$<$os-\/name$>$}} to the first command (the command which specifies the preset). Optionally, you can also use the flag {\bfseries{-\/DCMAKE\+\_\+\+OSX\+\_\+\+ARCHITECTURES}} to specify the architecture of the device or the simulator.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md14}{}\doxysubsection{vcpkg}\label{index_autotoc_md14}
scifir-\/units can be compiled with vcpkg inside every triplet of vcpkg, not only inside Windows. To do that, after installing icu and boost\+\_\+system in vcpkg, use the following commands\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{cmake -\/-\/preset=vcpkg}
\DoxyCodeLine{cmake -\/-\/build -\/-\/preset=vcpkg}
\DoxyCodeLine{cmake -\/-\/install ./build/vcpkg}

\end{DoxyCode}
\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md15}{}\doxysubsection{Android}\label{index_autotoc_md15}
First, set {\bfseries{ANDROID\+\_\+\+HOME}} and {\bfseries{ANDROID\+\_\+\+NDK\+\_\+\+ROOT}} to the paths of your Android SDK installation and of your Android NDK installation. After that, install vcpkg, and set the environment variable {\bfseries{VCPKG\+\_\+\+ROOT}} to the installation directory of vcpkg. Set also the environment variable {\bfseries{VCPKG\+\_\+\+DEFAULT\+\_\+\+TRIPLET}} to be the triplet of the computer you\textquotesingle{}re using to build scifir-\/units. Finally, to compile scifir-\/units to work inside an Android application that uses Android NDK for that purpose, you have to use the following commands\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{cmake -\/-\/preset=android -\/DCMAKE\_INSTALL\_PREFIX=<path-\/to-\/android-\/project>}
\DoxyCodeLine{cmake -\/-\/build -\/-\/preset=android}
\DoxyCodeLine{cmake -\/-\/install ./build/android}

\end{DoxyCode}


After building scifir-\/units you have to move the library file to your Android project. Inside Android Studio, create the JNI folder under the right-\/click menu of the {\bfseries{app folder}}, under the option {\bfseries{New $>$ Folder $>$ JNI Folder}}. Inside the jni folder, you should create a folder for each {\bfseries{Android ABI}} existing, and add scifir-\/units there compiled for that Android ABI by using the option {\bfseries{-\/DANDROID\+\_\+\+ABI}} of this cmake configuration. Search all Android ABIs existing and compile this library for each of them, in order to have your Android application working on all Android devices.

The include path for scifir-\/units inside your Android Studio project should be the same as the linux distribution, vcpkg or mingw, use the same as always. The headers of scifir-\/units, then, as any C++ library for Android, doesn\textquotesingle{}t need to be copied inside your Android project and, then, they aren\textquotesingle{}t part of the final {\bfseries{APK file}}.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md16}{}\doxysubsection{Microcontrollers}\label{index_autotoc_md16}
For electronics, you can build scifir-\/units using the compiler of your microcontroller, which comes with the SDK of your microcontroller. You have to specify, using the option {\bfseries{-\/DCMAKE\+\_\+\+CXX\+\_\+\+COMPILER}}, the compiler to use, and, also, you have to use the option {\bfseries{-\/DCMAKE\+\_\+\+CXX\+\_\+\+FLAGS=\char`\"{}-\/mmcu=$<$microcontroller-\/model$>$\char`\"{}}} to specify the model of your microcontroller in order for your compiler to know for which microcontroller model to compile.

The SDK of microcontrollers can be downloaded on the website of the vendor of the microcontroller, which can be {\bfseries{Microchip}}, {\bfseries{STMicroelectronics}}, or any other.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md17}{}\doxysubsection{cpack}\label{index_autotoc_md17}
If you need to package scifir-\/units into any format supported by cpack, you just need to use the preset that you\textquotesingle{}ve previously used to build scifir-\/units.


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{cpack -\/-\/preset=<your-\/preset> -\/G <generator-\/needed>}

\end{DoxyCode}


You can type the command {\bfseries{cpack --help}} to check all available generators.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md18}{}\doxysubsection{ctest}\label{index_autotoc_md18}
You can test scifir-\/units executing ctest if you want. It\textquotesingle{}s not needed to execute those tests in your local computer, but you can do it if for any reason you find it helpful. To build the tests, add the flags {\bfseries{-\/DBUILD\+\_\+\+TESTING=ON}} to the first preset command, in order to set the variable BUILD\+\_\+\+TESTING to ON, that variable configures the build to build also all the tests.


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{ctest -\/-\/preset=<your-\/preset>}

\end{DoxyCode}
\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md19}{}\doxysection{Using the library}\label{index_autotoc_md19}
First you have to link {\bfseries{scifir-\/units}} to your project. To link scifir-\/units, after installing it following the steps above, add the following code inside your CMake\+Lists.\+txt file\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{target\_link\_libraries(your-\/project scifir-\/units)}

\end{DoxyCode}


Now that the library es linked, you can use it inside your code by including the {\bfseries{header \char`\"{}scifir/units.\+hpp\char`\"{}}}.


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\#include "{}scifir/units.hpp"{}}

\end{DoxyCode}
\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md20}{}\doxysection{Introduction}\label{index_autotoc_md20}
The Scifir Collection is a set of libraries that allows to create the software of scientific inventions, being them scientific machines or just scientific software. This library, scifir-\/units, allows to handle scalar and vectorial units inside the code. They are very lightweight, they size similar to a float, and can be used extensively to do any math calculation necessary for the invention. The prefixes can be changed, in order to display the units in the more proper dimensions. Also, all the conversions known are supported. Then, instead of the meter, a length can be described by a light-\/year, an astronomical unit (AU), among other units of measure.

The unit classes that scifir-\/units provides are the following\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{scalar\+\_\+unit\+:}} Handles scalar units. It covers vectors in 1D too.
\item {\bfseries{vector\+\_\+unit\+\_\+2d\+:}} Handles vector units in 2D dimensions. It inherits scalar\+\_\+unit.
\item {\bfseries{vector\+\_\+unit\+\_\+3d\+:}} Handles vector units in 3D dimensions. It inherits scalar\+\_\+unit.
\item {\bfseries{vector\+\_\+unit\+\_\+nd\+:}} Handles vector units in ND dimensions. It inherits scalar\+\_\+unit.
\end{DoxyItemize}

scalar\+\_\+unit classes can be used both for scalar units and vector units in 1D. In the case of vector units in 1D, a negative value indicates, as on math, that it points to the left on the x axis. Otherwise, if the value is positive, it points to the right.

All the unit classes have fixed dimensions. Once instantiated, they can\textquotesingle{}t change to a different set of dimensions. Besides that, prefixes and abbreviations can be used freely, every unit can change to any other prefix and use any abbreviation that matches the original dimensions (and no other set of dimensions).

There are also special units inside scifir-\/units. Those special units are aid, color, percentage, pH, pixel, p\+OH, size\+\_\+2d, size\+\_\+3d, size\+\_\+nd and zid. {\bfseries{Always prefer pH}} over p\+OH, p\+OH is provided by the library only for very infrequent cases.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md21}{}\doxysubsection{Class list}\label{index_autotoc_md21}
The most important classes are the scalar units and the vector units. Vector units are in 2D, 3D and ND (a variable number of dimensions).


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item scalar\+\_\+unit.
\item vector\+\_\+unit\+\_\+2d.
\item vector\+\_\+unit\+\_\+3d.
\item vector\+\_\+unit\+\_\+nd.
\item dimension.
\item prefix.
\item conversion.
\end{DoxyItemize}

The classes dimension, prefix and conversion are intended for {\bfseries{internal use}} mainly, but they can be used if they are needed.

The basic unit classes that inherit scalar\+\_\+unit and use, then, too, dimension and prefix classes, are the following\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item length.
\item time\+\_\+duration.
\item mass.
\item charge.
\item temperature.
\item mole.
\item light.
\item data.
\end{DoxyItemize}

Apart from those basic scalar\+\_\+unit subclasses, there are a great amount of more unit classes defined, that are derived from scalar\+\_\+unit or from vector\+\_\+unit. All scalar unit subclasses derive from scalar\+\_\+unit, and all vector unit subclasses are defined one time for 2d, one time for 3d, one time for nd, and one time for the scalar\+\_\+unit case. Then, force units, which are vector units, exist as force, force\+\_\+2d, force\+\_\+3d and force\+\_\+nd.

All those additional unit classes are the following\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{Astronomy\+:}} specific\+\_\+angular\+\_\+momentum, specific\+\_\+angular\+\_\+momentum\+\_\+2d, specific\+\_\+angular\+\_\+momentum\+\_\+3d, specific\+\_\+angular\+\_\+momentum\+\_\+nd

The meca numbers are special numbers that don\textquotesingle{}t behave exactly like an scalar unit\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item angle.
\item complex\+\_\+number$<$\+T$>$.
\item lab\+\_\+number$<$\+T$>$.
\end{DoxyItemize}

The coordinates classes handle position in space. The point classes also handle position in space. Coordinates are used for positions and points are intended for more stationary cases, like for example vertex of triangles that form a 3D model.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item coordinates\+\_\+1d$<$\+T$>$.
\item coordinates\+\_\+2d$<$\+T$>$.

\item point\+\_\+3d$<$\+T$>$.
\item point\+\_\+nd$<$\+T$>$.
\item direction.

The special unit classes handle special cases of values\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}

\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md22}{}\doxysubsection{Data conventions}\label{index_autotoc_md22}
It\textquotesingle{}s mandatory to follow the {\bfseries{data conventions}} of Scifir when using scifir-\/units, which is used not only for this library but also for every Scifir project. The data conventions of Scifir allow to handle data easy without multiple interpretations of the meaning of any value, because it doesn\textquotesingle{}t has ambiguities.

The conventions are the following\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{Units\+:}} All units are stored identical to their initialization string, as text.
\item {\bfseries{Genes\+:}} Genes are stored by their gene name, following the {\bfseries{scifir nomenclature of genes}}.
\item {\bfseries{Molecules\+:}} Molecules are stored by their IUPAC name, canonicalized.
\item {\bfseries{Zones\+:}} Zones are stored by their ZID initialization string.
\item {\bfseries{Positions\+:}} Positions are stored writing their zone, and, in parentheses, the geographic coordinates.
\item {\bfseries{Languages\+:}} Languages are stored by their language code of the ISO of languages.
\item {\bfseries{Countries\+:}} Countries are stored by their country code of the ISO of countries.
\item {\bfseries{Currencies\+:}} Currrencies are stored by their currency code of the ISO of currencies.
\item {\bfseries{Phone numbers\+:}} Phone numbers are stored with their phone code of the ISO of phone codes.
\end{DoxyItemize}

The conventions for storing informatic data are the following\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{Ip addresses\+:}} Store the ip, as is written.
\item {\bfseries{Computers\+:}} Store computers by their model name, canonicalized.

The scalar\+\_\+unit and vector unit classes, vector\+\_\+unid\+\_\+2d, vector\+\_\+unid\+\_\+3d and vector\+\_\+unit\+\_\+nd size more than a single float, which uses 4 bytes, but don\textquotesingle{}t size a big amount and so, they can be used in great quantities for any purpose, cause they are very lightweight.

The angle class uses only 4 bytes, and works perfectly fine, very similar to a normal float. Then, you can use it freely every time you need to do calculations that need angles.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md24}{}\doxysection{Use cases}\label{index_autotoc_md24}
\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md25}{}\doxysubsection{Technologies for inventions}\label{index_autotoc_md25}
scifir-\/units can be used for any project that needs units of measurement, vectors, coordinates, and related calculations. It\textquotesingle{}s primary intended to program {\bfseries{scientific inventions}}, {\bfseries{laboratory machines}}, {\bfseries{electronic devices}} and {\bfseries{medical devices}} (medical devices that need a software, not any medical device). In this section it\textquotesingle{}s explained how to build those devices, in order to be known how to create all the project, and not only how to use scifir-\/units.

To create the electronic circuit of any electronic device, being it a scientific invention, a laboratory machine, a medical device or of other type, you can use {\bfseries{Ki\+Cad}}. The electronic circuit is then printed using the file created with Ki\+Cad. For the operating system, you can use {\bfseries{Free\+RTOS}}, {\bfseries{Free\+BSD}}, or even create a custom linux distribution with {\bfseries{Linux From Scratch}}. For the GUI of the software of the invention to run inside this operating system, you can use {\bfseries{GTK+}}, {\bfseries{wx\+Widgets}} or {\bfseries{Qt}}. The inventions not always use a GUI, they can work just with analog buttons or a LCD display. It\textquotesingle{}s with this software where you can use scifir-\/units to do the calculations the software requires.

To build a desktop application that connects remotely with the invention, use also GTK+, wx\+Widgets or Qt to build the GUI. You can use as communication technology {\bfseries{bluetooth}}, {\bfseries{wifi direct}} (which is a wifi peer-\/to-\/peer) or {\bfseries{usb}}.

Also, to add 3D to the software, you can use {\bfseries{Open\+GL}}. To do plots, use {\bfseries{matplot++}}, {\bfseries{gnuplot}} or {\bfseries{GNU plotutils}}. Obviously, to store output from the software, you can use {\bfseries{YAML}} or {\bfseries{XML}}. To work with XML inside C++ you can use {\bfseries{rapidxml}}, {\bfseries{tinyxml}} or {\bfseries{libxml2}}. To work with YAML you can use {\bfseries{yaml-\/cpp}}. Use {\bfseries{conf}} for configuration files, the library of it is {\bfseries{libconfig}}. To send messages between different servers/daemons that are run inside the invention, you can use {\bfseries{dbus}}. To handle large amounts of data, you can use a simple database, like {\bfseries{SQLite}}, with {\bfseries{SQLite\+CPP}}.

From the graphics part, you can use {\bfseries{SVG++}} to work with SVG files. To add GPS to the invention, you can use {\bfseries{gpsd}}. To do the translation of the software, use {\bfseries{gettext}}.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md26}{}\doxysubsection{Electronic devices}\label{index_autotoc_md26}
All scientific inventions and medical machines are electronic devices with more components. So, it\textquotesingle{}s first needed to know electronics. An electronic device is composed of an {\bfseries{electronic circuit}}, a {\bfseries{microcontroller}}, {\bfseries{electronic sensors}}, {\bfseries{output devices}}, {\bfseries{electronic motors}}, an {\bfseries{operating system}}, and the {\bfseries{software of the device}} (called {\bfseries{firmware}}).

The {\bfseries{electronic circuit}} connects all the different components and parts of the electronic device, and supplies energy and/or communication signals to each component.

The {\bfseries{microcontroller}} executes the software, and sends then signals to one or more electronic component.

The {\bfseries{electronic sensors}} measure properties of the environment and send them to the microcontroller, being it able then to read them.

The {\bfseries{output devices}} display the output data of the software in some form or another, it can be visual (the monitor), auditive (the speakers), etc.

The {\bfseries{electronic motors}} can be powered and controlled by the electronic circuit, and allow to control the movement, like for example the movement of the molecules through a tube.

The {\bfseries{operating system}} is the software that handles the processes of the microcontrollers, and executes one process or another, or more than one process at the same time. Good operating systems for electronic devices are {\bfseries{Free\+BSD}} and {\bfseries{Free\+RTOS}}.

The {\bfseries{firmware}} is the software of the electronic device, it\textquotesingle{}s usually executed inside an operating system, but it can be executed without an operating system too.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md27}{}\doxysubsection{Laboratory machines}\label{index_autotoc_md27}
A laboratory machine, additional to all the components of electronic devices, contains too output devices and/or input devices that allow to control and get data about the matter, which can be molecules, solids, gases, liquids, cells, or even exotic matter.

Laboratory machines in which to use units are, for example, {\bfseries{NMR spectroscopes}}, {\bfseries{IR spectroscopes}}, {\bfseries{DNA sequencers}}, {\bfseries{Gas chromatographs}}. {\bfseries{DNA synthesizers}}, a possible scientific invention present in the projects of Scifir, can also be benefited of units. {\bfseries{Printers at nanoscale}}, which are essential for {\bfseries{nanotechnology}}, are programmed easier, too, with units.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md28}{}\doxysubsection{Scientific inventions}\label{index_autotoc_md28}
A scientific invention different than a laboratory machine is done similar to those machines. Then, scientific inventions also need electronic components that handle matter. A usual different with laboratory machines is that the inventions usually need other parts too, like for example {\bfseries{spaceships}}, which need more mechanical components than the common laboratory machine. Despite that difference, to develop a laboratory machine is similar than to develop any scientific invention.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md29}{}\doxysubsection{Medical devices}\label{index_autotoc_md29}
A medical device usually controls the flow of some substance, or needs high precision for the position of some part of the machine, and for those purposes scifir-\/units helps.

Important medical devices which can be benefited with measurement of units are devices of {\bfseries{robotic surgery}}, {\bfseries{heart-\/lung machines}}, {\bfseries{mechanical ventilators}}, {\bfseries{anesthesic machines}}, {\bfseries{lasik machines}}, {\bfseries{x-\/ray machines}}, {\bfseries{magnetic resonance imaging machines}}, {\bfseries{ultrasound machines}}, {\bfseries{tomography machines}}.

Other simple devices as {\bfseries{pressure monitor}}, {\bfseries{heart rate monitor}} and {\bfseries{electrocardiograms}} are also improved with units.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md30}{}\doxysubsection{Robotics}\label{index_autotoc_md30}
{\bfseries{Robotics}} is the branch of science, mainly of informatics, whose subject of study are the robots. A {\bfseries{robotist}} is a scientist specialized in robotics.

A robot is built with electronics, apart from the components listed previously, it needs a {\bfseries{visual sensor}}, a {\bfseries{microphone}}, a {\bfseries{speaker}}, a {\bfseries{temperature sensor}}. It can have also a {\bfseries{sensor of molecules}}, in order to have a simulation of the {\bfseries{sense of odor}}. In order to build the human shape (or animal shape), you must know {\bfseries{machining}}, and use {\bfseries{molds}}, the {\bfseries{milling machine}} and/or the {\bfseries{lathe}} to build each part. For some robotic parts, you can use {\bfseries{carbon fiber}}.

All components of robots frequently need at least scalar units, if not also vector units, like for example the visual sensor or the microphone, and so you can use scifir-\/units inside your robotics projects.

Inside Scifir, it\textquotesingle{}s called {\bfseries{Universal Robotics}} an idea of Ismael Correa which consists of robots that can share essentially any part with the other robot. For that purpose, too, scifir-\/units is useful.

Each component of a robot, being a sensor or a removable part, should be programmed as an independent server inside the operating system of the robot. In that way, it can be restarted, and changed, without modifying the other parts. Then, the visual sensor, the speaker and the temperature sensor, should all be different servers inside the same OS.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md31}{}\doxysection{Core functionalities}\label{index_autotoc_md31}
All the classes of scifir-\/units are inside the {\bfseries{namespace scifir}}, as with all libraries of the {\bfseries{Scifir Collection}}. So, to use any of this classes, like angle, you have to type any of the following codes\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{keyword}{using namespace }\mbox{\hyperlink{namespacescifir}{scifir}}; \textcolor{comment}{// Maybe this is usually the better choice}}
\DoxyCodeLine{\mbox{\hyperlink{classscifir_1_1angle}{scifir::angle}} a; \textcolor{comment}{// You can use the namespace directly}}

\end{DoxyCode}


All the example code presented here is written assuming you know this namespace scifir.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md32}{}\doxysubsection{Initialization strings}\label{index_autotoc_md32}
All the unit classes, and also the other related classes of this library, can be constructed with what is called here an {\bfseries{initialization string}}. An initialization string is an string used to instantiate the class, and it\textquotesingle{}s also used when converting the class to an string for any purpose (like printing it on the screen).

The initialization strings are the following\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{angle}}\+: \char`\"{}37°\char`\"{}
\item {\bfseries{scalar\+\_\+unit}}\+: \char`\"{}1 km\char`\"{}
\item {\bfseries{vector\+\_\+unit\+\_\+2d}}\+: \char`\"{}5 km 10°\char`\"{}
\item {\bfseries{vector\+\_\+unit\+\_\+3d}}\+: \char`\"{}3 km 10° 20°\char`\"{}
\item {\bfseries{vector\+\_\+unit\+\_\+nd}}\+: \char`\"{}3 km 10° 20° 35°\char`\"{}
\item {\bfseries{point\+\_\+1d}}\+: \char`\"{}3 m\char`\"{} or \char`\"{}(3 m)\char`\"{}
\item {\bfseries{point\+\_\+2d}}\+: \char`\"{}2 m,4 m\char`\"{} or \char`\"{}(2 m,4 m)\char`\"{}
\item {\bfseries{point\+\_\+3d}}\+: \char`\"{}1 m,9 m,3 m\char`\"{} or \char`\"{}(1 m,9 m,3 m)\char`\"{}
\item {\bfseries{point\+\_\+nd}}\+: \char`\"{}3 m,2 m,4 m,1 m\char`\"{} or \char`\"{}(3 m,2 m,4 m,1 m)\char`\"{}
\item {\bfseries{coordinates\+\_\+1d}}\+: \char`\"{}1 m\char`\"{} or \char`\"{}(1 m)\char`\"{}
\item {\bfseries{coordinates\+\_\+2d}}\+: \char`\"{}1 m,2 m\char`\"{} or \char`\"{}(1 m,2 m)\char`\"{}
\item {\bfseries{coordinates\+\_\+3d}}\+: \char`\"{}1 m,7 m,5 m\char`\"{} or \char`\"{}(1 m,7 m,5 m)\char`\"{}
\item {\bfseries{coordinates\+\_\+nd}}\+: \char`\"{}1 m,7 m,5 m,8 m\char`\"{} or \char`\"{}(1 m,7 m,5 m,8 m)\char`\"{}
\item {\bfseries{coordinates\+\_\+2dr}}\+: \char`\"{}1 m,2 m;45°\char`\"{} or \char`\"{}(1 m,2 m;45°)\char`\"{}
\item {\bfseries{coordinates\+\_\+3dr}}\+: \char`\"{}1 m,7 m,5 m;17° 25°\char`\"{} or \char`\"{}(1 m,7 m,5 m;17° 25°)\char`\"{}
\item {\bfseries{coordinates\+\_\+ndr}}\+: \char`\"{}1 m,7 m,5 m,8 m;32° 56° 78°\char`\"{} or \char`\"{}(1 m,7 m,5 m,8 m;32° 56° 78°)\char`\"{}
\end{DoxyItemize}

In order to store units inside a file an initialization string should be used. For any purpose, when converting some of those classes to an string, the string initialization has to be always used.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md33}{}\doxysubsection{Space}\label{index_autotoc_md33}
Inside scifir-\/units the space can be measured with float or with length. Secondarily, any scalar\+\_\+unit can be used as measure of space, because inside science there are modelings of imaginary spaces, where the length is not used. Because of that reason, all coordinates and point classes are template classes that accept floats or scalar\+\_\+unit classes.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md34}{}\doxysubsection{Dimensions}\label{index_autotoc_md34}
Inside scifir-\/units a {\bfseries{basic dimension}} is a dimension considered basic under the SI system of units. Different to that, a {\bfseries{simple dimension}} is a dimension without any derived dimension. That\textquotesingle{}s, it\textquotesingle{}s a dimension that\textquotesingle{}s not an abbreviation of two or more other dimensions.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md35}{}\doxysubsection{Angle}\label{index_autotoc_md35}
An angle object manages angles. It stores angles in degrees, rather than in radians. It can be initialized to any degree between 0 and 360 (without including 360, cause this is identical to 0 in meaning), and any initialization that\textquotesingle{}s not inside this range of values gets automatically converted inside it, to his equivalent value between the range.

An example of use of angle is the following\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{comment}{// Constructors and instantiation}}
\DoxyCodeLine{angle y = 54; \textcolor{comment}{// Better constructor! Preferred method}}
\DoxyCodeLine{angle a = 367; \textcolor{comment}{// Gets converted to the value 7, because 7 is the equivalent of 367 inside 0 and 360}}
\DoxyCodeLine{angle b = angle(12);}
\DoxyCodeLine{angle c = angle(34\_Pa);}
\DoxyCodeLine{angle z = 23\_N; \textcolor{comment}{// Angles can be instantiated with units if that is needed, although it's not recommended}}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{comment}{// Angles operations with other angles}}
\DoxyCodeLine{angle b = a + x;}
\DoxyCodeLine{angle c = a -\/ x;}
\DoxyCodeLine{angle d = a * b;}
\DoxyCodeLine{angle e = a / c;}
\DoxyCodeLine{b += a;}
\DoxyCodeLine{c -\/= b;}
\DoxyCodeLine{e *= a;}
\DoxyCodeLine{c /= e;}
\DoxyCodeLine{d \string^= a;}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{comment}{// Numeric operations}}
\DoxyCodeLine{angle x = a + 3;}
\DoxyCodeLine{angle y = x -\/ 6;}

\DoxyCodeLine{x.invert(); \textcolor{comment}{// Inverts the angle, the orientation described by this angle points now in the opposite direction}}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{keywordtype}{float} y = float(x); \textcolor{comment}{// Angles can be converted to float}}

\end{DoxyCode}
\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md36}{}\doxysubsection{Scalar units}\label{index_autotoc_md36}
Scalar units and vector units are the central objects of scifir-\/units. They store a value and a set of dimensions, as units on science do. Scalar units are just normal values, while vector units have a value and a direction to which the vector points to.

Scalar units can operate with other scalar units, as well as with numeric primitive types. Functions like \mbox{\hyperlink{namespacescifir_a0fca35769fd130e4f6303660a24e6c83}{abs()}}, \mbox{\hyperlink{namespacescifir_adeff4b825414d35ce963977f181f1b5c}{sqrt()}} and \mbox{\hyperlink{namespacescifir_a421182d5f93abcbbaeadc7c14112bdd5}{to\+\_\+string()}} are supported. They have functions to operate with strings, and functions to operate with streams.

Scalar units can have any dimension of the SI system of units, or, also, any {\bfseries{custom dimension}}. A custom dimension is a dimension with an arbitrary name, which is commonly used inside some fields of science when there\textquotesingle{}s no name for a needed dimension.

An example of use of an scalar unit is the following\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{length x = 10\_m;}
\DoxyCodeLine{length y = length(8,\textcolor{stringliteral}{"{}mm"{}});}

The basic dimensions of this library, for scalar\+\_\+unit classes, all the different vector\+\_\+unit classes, and all other classes that handle units, are the following. They are all in SI units, excepting memo, which is a basic dimension created by Ismael Correa, the author of this library, to measure the size occupied by a memory inside the animal brain, including human brains.

There are also derived dimensions of those basic dimensions, which are documented in the reference. Yet, you should memorize all those basic dimensions.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md37}{}\doxysubsection{Vector units in 2D}\label{index_autotoc_md37}
Vector units in 2D allow to do calculations for lab machines and simulations of physics and other areas of science in 2 dimensions. They inherit scalar\+\_\+unit, and additional to his member-\/variables they include the member-\/variable theta, of class angle (described above).

\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md38}{}\doxysubsection{Vector units in 3D}\label{index_autotoc_md38}
Vector units in 3D are the most useful vectorial units. They allow to do all the simulations of physics and any other area of science in 3D, which is the most common scenario. To work, they have, as vector\+\_\+unit\+\_\+2d, a value, dimensions, and an angle theta, but they include the angle phi. So, they work as spherical coordinates, having cartesian projections for each axis. The class vector\+\_\+unit\+\_\+3d inherits from scalar\+\_\+unit, as vector\+\_\+unit\+\_\+2d, but not from vector\+\_\+unit\+\_\+2d, evading math errors that would be derived from that, because 2D and 3D dimensions are not mathematically equivalent in 2D (when projecting the x and y axis there appears the angle phi on the equations for the 3D cases).

\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md39}{}\doxysubsection{Vector units in ND}\label{index_autotoc_md39}
Vector units in ND are very interesting vector units. They allow to operate in ND, which means, inside scifir-\/units, that the dimensions can be changed. ND allows to operate in 1D, 2D, 3D and more dimensions at the same time. The way they allow that is with a vector$<$angle$>$ member-\/variable, which allows to control the angles of the n dimensions were the vector operates. For 2D it has one angle, as vector\+\_\+unit\+\_\+2d, and for 3D it has two angles, as vector\+\_\+unit\+\_\+3d. For 1D it doesn\textquotesingle{}t has any angle.

Coordinates in 1D allow to move any object, particle, solid or immaterial, through a 1D space. The coordinates\+\_\+1d class has been implemented as a template class, allowing to use any scalar\+\_\+unit, or, also, a single float. Any scalar\+\_\+unit can be used, because then coordinates\+\_\+1d allows to move in dimensions different than length, as dimensions on some science-\/fiction speculations are (because on some science-\/fiction ideas, a dimension can be anything).

point\+\_\+1d is equivalent in functionality as coordinates\+\_\+1d, it has the same member-\/variables and functions, its intended use is to be an abstract point in 1D, rather than a position in 1D (as coordinates\+\_\+1d are).

An example of use of coordinates\+\_\+1d is the following\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{coordinates\_1d<length> x = coordinates\_1d<length>(1\_m);}
\DoxyCodeLine{coordinates\_1d<length> y = coordinates\_1d<length>(length(3,\textcolor{stringliteral}{"{}km"{}}));}
\DoxyCodeLine{coordinates\_1d<length> z = coordinates\_1d<length>(\textcolor{stringliteral}{"{}4 dam"{}});}
\DoxyCodeLine{coordinates\_1d<float> z = coordinates\_1d<float>(12); \textcolor{comment}{// coordinates\_1d can be used with a float in order to save memory, or if any other unit is useful for the use case}}

coordinates\+\_\+2d class allows to create software with positions in 2D. It has a very similar interface to coordinates\+\_\+1d, it\textquotesingle{}s initialized with an string of the form \char`\"{}1 m,2 m\char`\"{} or \char`\"{}(1 m,2 m)\char`\"{} because the character \textquotesingle{}(\textquotesingle{} can be present or not. It\textquotesingle{}s, as coordinates\+\_\+1d, a template class, and can then specify coordinates of any scalar\+\_\+unit (usually, length), or with a float, if there\textquotesingle{}s no unit that represents adequately the coordinates, or if it\textquotesingle{}s needed to save some memory (because the float is lighter than a unit in his consumption of memory).

coordinates\+\_\+2d can be used as cartesian and as polar coordinates at the same time. It has x and y as member-\/variables, which can be of the type of any scalar\+\_\+unit or a float. When working with polar coordinates, the calculations are stored as x and y, that\textquotesingle{}s, as cartesian coordinates, but when accessing it, with functions like get\+\_\+p() and get\+\_\+theta(), they give the values in polar coordinates. Then, at the same time, coordinates\+\_\+2d behave as cartesian and as polar coordinates, by storing the values only once, not two times. Then, coordinates\+\_\+2d is like a dual object, it contains cartesian\+\_\+2d and polar\+\_\+coordinates inside.

point\+\_\+2d is equivalent to coordinates\+\_\+2d, it\textquotesingle{}s intended to be used as a point in 2D instead of as a position in 2D (as coordinates\+\_\+2d). point\+\_\+2d has the same functionalities as coordinates\+\_\+2d, that\textquotesingle{}s, the same functions and member-\/variables, but its use is intended to be semantic, it provides clarity as when in the program the data represents a position (as coordinates\+\_\+2d) or an abstract point in 2D (as point\+\_\+2d).

An {\bfseries{AID}}, acronym of {\bfseries{Astronomycal ID}}, is an identifier of an astronomical object, like planets, moons, galaxies, stars, and any other astronomical object.

A {\bfseries{ZID}}, acronym of {\bfseries{Zone ID}}, is an identifier of a zone, like a region, a district, a store, a lake, a country, and any other zone. A zone is defined here as any closed surface that can be drawn over an astronomycal object. A ZID is composed of the AID of which the zone pertains, and the zone itself.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md44}{}\doxysubsection{percentage}\label{index_autotoc_md44}

Internally, the library has some important mechanisms important to be known by a serious developer. Those important mechanisms are described here, in order to avoid the developer to read the code of the library and learn every detail.

The first important mechanism to describe is the static storage of custom dimensions. This storage is static, meaning that every time a unit of a dimension not registered is created, this storage is the one used, instead of the name being stored inside the instance. With that behavior, when instantiating a big amount of dimensions, a big amount of memory is saved. To refer to the static storage it\textquotesingle{}s used the char symbol\mbox{[}3\mbox{]} of the dimension class, which uses only 3 bytes instead of the bytes the full dimension name would use. Then, each instance of a dimension class, given that static storage, uses only 6 bytes of memory.

The square of dimensions works in the following way\+: If the dimension consist only of one type of dimension, independently as if the dimension is a basic dimension or an abbreviation, the dimensions get squared. If the dimension is of more than one type, all the abbreviations are then converted to their derived types, and the total result gets squared. If the dimensions can\textquotesingle{}t be squared because there\textquotesingle{}s an odd number of them, the dimensions are then initialized empty.
